# 🏡 Airbnb Price Optimization — AMII Capstone Project

> Machine learning technician certification 1

> Alberta Machine Inteligence Institute (AMII)

## Project Overview

The goal was to apply machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business problem from end to end — from initial problem scoping and data preparation to model development, evaluation, and presentation of insights in a stakeholder-ready format.

Our team's project focused on predicting the optimal nightly rent price for Airbnb listings using the publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The intended audience was real-world business stakeholders, and the project was scoped, executed, and presented with this professional context in mind.

## Business Objective

Determine if a host’s current price aligns with market expectations using surrounding market data. This will:

- Help hosts optimize rental prices to increase bookings and revenue.

- Help guests find fair-priced listings.

- Improve the Airbnb platform experience overall for both parties.

## ML Problem Framing

We framed this as a regression problem, where the target variable was the optimal nightly rent price of an Airbnb listing. The project followed the full ML lifecycle:

- Scoping the problem in a business context

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Feature engineering & preprocessing

- Model selection, training, and evaluation

- Business-aligned interpretation of results

## Tools & Techniques

📊 Data Preprocessing

- Missing value imputation (KNN-based)

- Categorical variable encoding

- Outlier detection and removal

- Feature scaling & normalization

- Deduplication

🧪 Modeling Techniques

- K-Nearest Neighbors Regression

- Decision Trees

- Linear Regression

- Ridge & Lasso Regression

- Random Forest Regression

📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- R² Score

- Business interpretation of TP/TN/FP/FN based on price classification ranges

- We also considered bias-variance tradeoffs and how they impacted stakeholder outcomes.
